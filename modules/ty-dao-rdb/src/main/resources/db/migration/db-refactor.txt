rename perms_on_pages to  page_perms  ?

split  page_users into:
  - page_members    â€” maybe  is_assigned?
  - page_visits
  - page_notf_prefs

users3 -> people3


could have:  category_perms3  and tag_perms3
but that's overkill.
Only  tag_label_perms.may_use  makes sense (says who may add/remove a tag with that label)
