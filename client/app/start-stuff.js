// Example: If running the Takyard server in a Vagrant VM, and accessing it on the host
// at localhost:8080 — then, by default, the Talkyard server generates e.g. email
// verification links pointing to port 80, the default HTTP port. However, when on the host
// port 8080 is in used (and mapped by Vagrant to 80 in the VM) — these port 80 server
// generated links won't work, and those who try out the server in Vagrant will get confused.
